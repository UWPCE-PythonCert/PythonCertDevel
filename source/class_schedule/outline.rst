Py1: Intro to Python

Session 1: Introductions & Overviews
Objectives:
Navigate the basics of the python development environment, including:
Basic command line environment

Methods of writing and running scripts

Find and use documentation

Use git at a basic level

Python Overview: What is Python and what are its major features?
Python Language Primitives: data types, basic flow control.
Dev Environment Overview: What tools do you need to develop programs in Python?
Introduction to source control: Basic git.
Python Kick Start.

Organizing your Programs
Truthiness
Booleans
Ternary Expressions
If .. elif .. else
Functions
 Modules and namespaces
Importing
Sequences, Slicing and Iteration
Lists, Tuples, Strings
slicing
Iteration
String methods
String formatting
Collections and I/O
Dictionaries
Sets
Files (probably a good place to introduce context managers from a client perspective, but not a server perspective if you know what I mean)


Title: tbd
Exceptions
Basic Unit testing: pytest
Advanced Argument Passing
Functions as first class language constructs: passing functions to functions
OO1:  Intro to Object Oriented Programming

Multiple Inheritance
Protocols
Emulating standard types by overriding special methods
FP1:  Introduction to Functional Programming

Advanced Python Language Constructs (made easy-ish)
Decorators
Context Managers
Meta Programming
Meta Classes

AT THIS POINT WE’RE FINALLY DONE WITH THE CORE OF THE LANGUAGE AND WE’RE MOVING ON TO HOW TO WORK EFFECTIVELY IN PYTHON’S ECOSYSTEM. THIS IS STUFF THAT WOULD FORMERLY HAVE GONE INTO “SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT WITH PYTHON” AKA PY300. THIS IS A MUCH BETTER LAYOUT THAN INSERTING THE FORMER PY200/WEBDEV CLASS INTO THIS CONCEPTUAL STREAM.
