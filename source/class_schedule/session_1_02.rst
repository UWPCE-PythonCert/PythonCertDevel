Intro to Python Session 2
#########################

Pre-class prep
==============

Dev environment
---------------

Make sure you know how to create a python file, save it, edit it, run it, etc.

Also make sure you are comfortable "playing" with python in the iPython command line.

If you are uncomfortable with the command line, brush up on that: `This: <https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/appendixa.html>`_ is a good tutorial.

Python
------

Go through one or more of these tutorials:

Every one of you has a different background and learning style. So take a bit of time to figure out which resource works for you.

:ref:`python_learning_resources`

Provides some options. Do look it over.

But here are few to get you started this week:

*Think Python:* Chapters 1–3 (or more...) (http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html)

*Dive Into Python:* Chapters 1–2, 4 (http://www.diveintopython3.net/)

*LPTHW:* ex. 1–10, 18-21 (https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/)
(note: LPTHW used to be totally free --now it looks like you may only get a sneak peak -- darn!)

Or follow this excellent introductory tutorial:

You should be comfortable with working with variables, numbers, strings,
and basic functions.

We are only using a small subset of git functionality for this class,
but if you feel lost, these are some good resources:
