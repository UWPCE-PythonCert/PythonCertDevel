-----------------------------------

**Unit Testing:**

* Dive into Python: chapter 9:
  http://www.diveintopython3.net/unit-testing.html

NOTE: you will find that most introductions to unit testing with Python use the builtin ``unitest`` module. However, it is a bit heavyweight, and requires some knowledge of OOP -- classes, etc. So we'll be using pytest in this class: http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/. But the principles of testing are the same.

* Ned Batchelder's intro to testing presentation:
