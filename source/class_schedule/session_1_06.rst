Intro to Python Session 6

Pre-class prep
==============

Material to review before next week
-----------------------------------

**Unit Testing:**

* Dive into Python: chapter 9:
  http://www.diveintopython3.net/unit-testing.html

NOTE: you will find that most introductions to unit testing with Python use the builtin ``unitest`` module. However, it is a bit heavyweight, and requires some knowledge of OOP -- classes, etc. So we'll be using pytest in this class: http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/. But the principles of testing are the same.

* Ned Batchelder's intro to testing presentation:

* :ref:`advanced_argument_passing`

* arguments and parameters:

In-class Activities
===================

Exercises:
----------

:ref:`exercise_args_kwargs_lab`

Testing mailroom:
.................

Write a complete set of unit tests for your mailroom program.

   * You will likely find that it is really hard to test without refactoring.

   * This is Good!

   * If code is hard to test -- it probably should be refactored.

Post-class Activities
=====================

Finish the exercises

Look at the next session for reading, etc:

Material to review for next week
--------------------------------

Next week, we'll get started on Object Oriented Methods. It's a good idea to read up on it first -- so we can dive right in:

 * Dive into Python3: 7.2 -- 7.3
   http://www.diveintopython3.net/iterators.html#defining-classes

 * Think Python: 15 -- 18
   http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython016.html

 * LPTHW: 40 -- 44
   http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex40.html

[note that in py3 you don't need to inherit from object]
