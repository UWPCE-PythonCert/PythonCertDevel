Using gitHub
############

We use gitHub in the program to provide a platform for students to submit their work, and instructors to review that work.

gitHub provides a good platform for code review, and it also provides the students with some experience with an industry-standard platform.

The class repo
==============

Example Code
============

Examples are in the PythonCert Repo under examples. Most of the single file examples are provided as download links in the course materials. But some examples get to be too big to be a simple single file download.

You may want to copy examples to the class repo, for easy access by the students.

I also find that I often will update and re-work examples, as well as provide new ones, during the class sessions. It's a good idea to make those available int he class repo as well.

If you develop a nice example that may be useful to other instructors / classes, consider adding it to the examples in the main PythonCertDevel repo.
