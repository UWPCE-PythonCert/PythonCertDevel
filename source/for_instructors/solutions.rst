Exercise Solutions
##################

A complete set of solutions is available in the PythonCertDevel Repo.

I've found that students really like to see clean, nicely written solutions to the exercises -- when I started teaching, I would go over the students' code in class, and correct and critique it. But I got a lot of requests for how *I* would have written the code. So I ended up developing a full set of solutions to share with the class.

When / How to Share Solutions
=============================

I've struggled for years over the best way and time to share my solutions. Some students get stuck, and really need to see how it can be done to get them over the hump. Other students would rather not be tempted to look at a solution before they have really given in a solid try.

What I've settled on is to provide the solutions to an exercise on the day it is due. That gives students a good bit of time to do it on their own, but then they have something to look at if they had not succeeded on their own.

I add the solutions to the class repo, so that they have easy access to it.

This does mean that solutions are available in other public repos on gitHub -- but I figure if folks are enterprising enough to find them, then more power to them. Ultimately, they are in charge of their own education -- if they "cheat", they won't learn.

The self-paced class
--------------------

As each student is has a different "due date" for each exercise in the self paced class, it's not possible to post solutions when the exercises are due. So another approach must be taken.

Updating the Solutions
======================

I like to think I've got some pretty good solutions in place, but any code can be made better. And we do update the exercises a bit sometimes, so the solutions may need updating too.

Please provide a PR for updated or alternate solutions if you have them.
