Introduction to This Class
==========================

The overall class is managed by a learning managment system -- Canvs or EdX.

You have gotten a link to the instance for the class sent to you. IN fact, you probably found this page with a link from there.

Class Structure
---------------

We will be using a variation of a
`"flipped classroom" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom>`_
for this program.

This means that the "homework" will be reading, watching videos, coding, etc.

And class time will be spent primarly coding:

 * Still some lecture -- as little as possible
 * Lots of demos
 * Working on Coding Exercises:
   - On your own, with us to help
   - In small groups
   - Instructor led.

This means that you are expected to complete the reading BEFORE each class. That way, we don't have to take class time introducing the basic material and can focus on questions and applying what you've read about.

Interrupt with questions -- please!

(Some of the best learning prompted by questions)

Homework:
---------

* Homework will primarily be reading, a handful of videos, and links to optional external materials -- videos, blog posts, etc.

* Exercises will be started in class -- but you can finish them at home.

* You are adults -- it's up to you to do the homework. But if you dont code, you won't learn to code...

* To submit your work, you can do a gitHub "pull request" to the class repo.

There is a video about that, and we will show you in the first class as well.

Communication
-------------

**Mailing list:**

You should have been subscribed to the mailing list, if not talk to your instructors.

We will be using this list to communicate with you. If you have not gotten notes from the list -- make sure to let your instructors know, and we'll make sure to add you.

Slack may set up a slack channel for discussions. Anything python related is fair game.  We'll poll the class in the first session to decide if that would be helpful.

We highly encourage you to work together. You will learn at a much deeper level if you work together, and it gets you ready to collaborate with colleagues. If you have never used slack before, you may want to look at their intro:

Office Hours
------------

We will generally will hold "office hours" at a coffee shop for a couple hours each weekend.  We will try to have one on Saturday, and one on Sunday.

Please feel free to attend even if you do not have a specific question. It is an opportunity to work with the instructors and fellow students, and learn from each other.

What are good times for you?

And what locations?
