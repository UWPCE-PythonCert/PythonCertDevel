Class Structure
---------------

Class Time:

 * Some lecture -- as little as possible
 * Lots of demos
 * Lab time: lots of hand-on practice
   - Take a break if you need one then...
 * Lather, Rinse, Repeat.....

Interrupt with questions -- please!

(Some of the best learning prompted by questions)

Homework:
---------

* Homework will be reading, exercises, and the occasional Video

* Exercises will be started in class -- but you can finish them at home.

* You are adults -- it's up to you to do it

* You can do a gitHub "pull request" if you want us to review your work.

    - We'll show you how to do that next

Communication
-------------

**Mailing list:**

We've set up a Google Group for this class:

programming-in-python@googlegroups.com

We will be using this list to communicate with you. You should have (or will soon) received an email invitation to join t\
he mailing list.

Slack: We have set up a slack channel for discussions. Anything python related is fair game.

https://python2017-fall.slack.com/

We highly encourage you to work together. You will learn at a much deeper level if you work together,
and it gets you ready to collaborate with colleagues. If you have never used slack before, you may want to look at their intro:

Office Hours
------------

We will generally will hold "office hours" at a coffee shop for a couple hours
each weekend.

Please feel free to attend even if you do not have a specific question.
It is an opportunity to work with the instructors and fellow students,
and learn from each other.

What are good times for you?

And what locations?

Lightning Talks
----------------

**Lightning Talks:**

 * 5 minutes each (including setup) - no kidding!
 * Every student will give one
 * Purposes: introduce yourself, share interests, show Python applications
 * Any topic you like that is related to Python -- according to you!
