Context Managers

You've seen the ``with`` statement -- probably used for working with files. Now you'll learn what that's all about.

Managing Resources
==================

**Repetition in code stinks (DRY!)**

A large source of repetition in code deals with the handling of external
resources.

As an example, how many times do you think you might type something like the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    file_handle = open('filename.txt', 'r')
    file_content = file_handle.read()
    file_handle.close()
    # do some stuff with the contents

Not only is this a couple extra lines of code to write, it's also prone to error:

What happens if you forget to call ``.close()``?

What happens if reading the file raises an exception?

So you really should write it something like:

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        file_handle = open(...)
        file_content = file_handle.read()
    except IOError:
        print("The file couldn't be opened")
    finally:
        file_handle.close()

And that is getting pretty ugly, and hard to get right.

Handling General Resources
--------------------------

Leaving an open file handle laying around is bad enough. What if the resource
is a network connection, or a database cursor?

Starting in version 2.5, Python provides a structure for reducing the
repetition needed to handle resources like this.

**Context Managers**

You can encapsulate the setup, error handling, and teardown of resources in a
few simple steps.

The key is to use the ``with`` statement.

``with`` a little help
----------------------

Since the introduction of the ``with`` statement in `pep343 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/>`_, the above seven lines of defensive code have been replaced with this simple form:

.. code-block:: python

    with open('filename', 'r') as file_handle:
        file_content = file_handle.read()
    # do something with file_content

The ``open`` builtin is defined as a *context manager*.

The resource it returns (``file_handle``) is automatically and reliably closed
when the code block ends.

At this point in Python history, many functions you might expect to behave this way do:

* ``open`` works as a context manager.
* network connections via ``socket`` do as well.
* most implementations of database wrappers can open connections or cursors as
  context managers.
* ...

* But what if you are working with a library that doesn't support this
  (``urllib``)?


Close It Automatically
----------------------

There are a couple of ways you can go.

If the resource in questions has a ``.close()`` method, then you can simply use the ``closing`` context manager from ``contextlib`` to handle the issue:

.. code-block:: python

    from urllib import request
    from contextlib import closing

    with closing(request.urlopen('http://google.com')) as web_connection:
        # do something with the open resource
    # and here, it will be closed automatically

But what if the thing doesn't have a ``close()`` method, or you're creating
the thing and it shouldn't have a close() method?

(full confession: urlib.request was not a context manager in py2 -- but it is in py3 -- but th issue still comes up with third-party packages ans your own code!)

Do It Yourself
--------------

If you do need to support resource management of some sort, you can context manager of your own withe the context manager protocol.

The interface is simple.  It must be a class that implements two
more of the nifty python *special methods*

``__enter__(self)``:
  Called when the ``with`` statement is run, it should return something to work with in the created context.

``__exit__(self, e_type, e_val, e_traceback)``:
  Clean-up that needs to happen is implemented here.

The arguments will be the exception raised in the context.

If the exception will be handled here, return ``True``. If not, return ``False``.

Let's see this in action to get a sense of what happens.

An Example
----------

Consider this code:

.. code-block:: python

    class Context(object):
        """from Doug Hellmann, PyMOTW
        https://pymotw.com/3/contextlib/#module-contextlib
        """
        def __init__(self, handle_error):
            print('__init__({})'.format(handle_error))
            self.handle_error = handle_error

        def __enter__(self):
            print('__enter__()')
            return self

        def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
            print('__exit__({}, {}, {})'.format(exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb))
            return self.handle_error

:download:`context_manager.py <../examples/context_managers/context_manager.py>`

This class doesn't do much of anything, but playing with it can help
clarify the order in which things happen:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [2]: %paste
        In [46]: with Context(True) as foo:
           ....:     print('This is in the context')
           ....:     raise RuntimeError('this is the error message')

    ## -- End pasted text --
    __init__(True)
    __enter__()
    This is in the context
    __exit__(<class 'RuntimeError'>, this is the error message,
             <traceback object at 0x1047873c8>)

Because the exit method returns True, the raised error is 'handled'.

What if we try with ``False``?

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [3]: with Context(False) as foo:
       ...:     print("this is in the context")
       ...:     raise RuntimeError('this is the error message')
       ...:
    __init__(False)
    __enter__()
    this is in the context
    __exit__(<class 'RuntimeError'>, this is the error message, <traceback object at 0x10349e888>)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-3-8837b3d7f123> in <module>()
          1 with Context(False) as foo:
          2     print("this is in the context")
    ----> 3     raise RuntimeError('this is the error message')

    RuntimeError: this is the error message

So this time, the context manager did not catch the error -- so it was raised the in the usual way.

The parameters to ``__exit__``
------------------------------

In real life, a context manager could have pretty much any error raised in its context.  And the context manager will likely only be able to "properly" handle particular Exceptions.

So the ``__exit__`` method takes all the information about the exception as parameters:

``def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb)``

``exc_type``: the type of the Exception

``exc_val``: the value of the Exception

``exc_tb``: the Exception Traceback object

The type lets you check if this is a type you know how to handle::

    if exc_type is RuntimeError:

The value is the exception object itself.

And the traceback is a full traceback object.


The ``contextmanager`` decorator
--------------------------------

``contextlib.contextmanager`` turns generator functions into context managers.

Consider this code:

.. code-block:: python

    from contextlib import contextmanager

    @contextmanager
    def context(boolean):
        print("__init__ code here")
        try:
            print("__enter__ code goes here")
            yield object()
        except Exception as e:
            print("errors handled here")
            if not boolean:
                raise e
        finally:
            print("__exit__ cleanup goes here")


The code is similar to the class defined previously.

And using it has similar results.  We can handle errors:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [96]: with context(True):
       ....:     print("in the context")
       ....:     raise RuntimeError("error raised")
       ....:
    __init__ code here
    __enter__ code goes here
    in the context
    errors handled here
    __exit__ cleanup goes here


Or, we can allow them to propagate:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [51]: with context(False):
       ....: print("in the context")
       ....: raise RuntimeError("error raised")
    __init__ code here
    __enter__ code goes here
    in the context
    errors handled here
    __exit__ cleanup goes here
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-51-641528ffa695> in <module>()
          1 with context(False):
          2     print "in the context"
    ----> 3     raise RuntimeError("error raised")
          4
    RuntimeError: error raised

You can even use context managers with ``yield``:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.fixture
    def example_fixture(request):
        # setup code here
        with open("a_test_filename") as test_file:
            yield test_file  # provide the fixture value

And that's it!

When the fixture is first invoked, it will yield the test_file.
It will then save the state, with the file open until ``next()``
is called again - time for the teardown.

But there is no more code after the yield -- so it falls out of the
context manager, and the file is closed.
