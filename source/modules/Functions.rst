Functions
=========

We have seen some of the building blocks of programs such as basic data structures, conditional flow control statements like ``if`` and looping constructs such as ``while`` and ``for``. We can do quite a lot with these constructs alone.

Take a moment to think about what your programs will look like using only these constructs. If you are relatively new to programming this should be easy. If you've been around for awhile, you may need to forget some of what you already know for this thought experiment to work.

Using only the basic building blocks you start at the top of your program. You likely declare a few variables toward the top.

.. code-block:: python



.. code-block:: python

    def addOne(x):
        return x + 1


.. code-block:: python

    def fun(x, y=None):
        if y is None:
            do_something_different
        go_on_here
