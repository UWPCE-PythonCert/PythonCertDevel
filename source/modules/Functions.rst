Functions
=========

We have seen some of the building blocks of programs such as basic data structures, conditional flow control statements like ``if`` and looping constructs such as ``while`` and ``for``. We can do quite a lot with these constructs alone.

.. code-block:: python

    def addOne(x):
        return x + 1


.. code-block:: python

    def fun(x, y=None):
        if y is None:
            do_something_different
        go_on_here
