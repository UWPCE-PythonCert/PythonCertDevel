Turning Atom Into a Lightweight Python IDE
**************************************************


Atom is the self-proclaimed "hackable text editor for the 21st Century." It has a nice
modern interface, and is highly customizable yet can also be used productively
with minimal setup and configuration.


Which Version?
==============

The latest version is the best version. Atom is regularly maintained, so that latest
version will have the latest bug fixes and updates. Click the big red button_ to
download, then run the executable to install.

If you already have Atom installed, but want to check for a newer version, go to
Help --> Check for Update.


Basic Settings
==============

Atom can be used out of the box with no setup as a simple text editor. It automatically
recognizes file types and helpfully highlights text accordingly. To use in this manner,
write your Python files in Atom, then run them in your Python command prompt.


Extending the Editor
====================

Atom has great documentation_ on how to hack and configure it. Read the Flight Manual_ for tons of information on
everything you can do. You can also watch a Getting Started video_.

Useful Packages
==============

Script
------

To run Python scripts within Atom, you will need to install the Script package.

Autocompletion
--------------

By default, Atom knows which Python packages you have imported, variables you have created
and so on. Autocomplete requires no setup.


Code Linting
------------



White Space Management
----------------------

Atom knows when you are writing Python and helps you out by dealing with spaces and tabs
in the same way. When in a Python file, if you type 4 spaces, then hit delete, you are
taken back a tab.

There are also some handy Whitespace tools built-in. Under the Packages --> Whitespace menu,
you will find tools to turn all tabs into spaces, all spaces into tabs, among other whitespace-related options.
