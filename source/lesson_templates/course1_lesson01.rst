Course Intro:
=============

[Paragraph introducing lesson to students]

Learning to program, whether in Python or in any other language, is about more than lerning the fundamentals of the language. Learning to program also involves learning the tools involved. You might liken it to carpentry. Without an adequatly provisioned workshop, without tools appropriate for the job, a carpenter wouldn't get very far.

Under ideal circumstances learning to program also involves learning to collaboate with others on code development. Working with other programmers is one of the best ways to improve as a programmer. The tools involved in collaboration are also a part of a programmers's workshop.

In this lesson we are looking to provision your workshop. We are going to set up an environment that will faciliate the collaborative creattion of Python code. We are also going to introuduce you to Python itself.

.. Fragments below:

.. Along the way you will find recommendations and suggestions, in some cases different approaches toward the same goal. We fully expect that as you mature as a programmer, and gain experience with different tools, you will choose certain tools over others, just as an experienced carpenter will develop a taste for specific tools for specific jobs over others. Before we get ahead of ourselves however, let's

.. And of course learning to program means understanding the fundamentals of the language itself.

.. Moreover an experienced carpenter is going to be more pikcy about their tools than an amateur, insisting on the right tool at the right time.
