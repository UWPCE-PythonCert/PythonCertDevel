# It doesn't -- coroutines do not support sending data in - they pass out results to the main loop, and then finally return something, which gets caught in the StopIteration exception -- but the value sent in is ignored.

# This is because coroutines were originaly built from generators, and they still borrow the same methods -- even though they don't do anythign with the value sent in.

# And if you have nested coroutines, the values do get passed up the chain one at a time.
