Documentation
=============

It's often helpful to leave information in your code about what you were
thinking when you wrote it.

This can help reduce the number of `WTFs per minute <http://www.osnews.com/story/19266/WTFs_m>`_ when reading it later.

There are two approaches to this in Python:

* Comments
* Docstrings

Comments in Python are much the same as any other programing language.

Docstrings are more unusual.

Comments
--------

Comments go inline in the body of your code, to explain reasoning:

.. code-block:: python

    if (frobnaglers > whozits):
        # borangas are shermed to ensure frobnagler population
        # does not grow out of control
        sherm_the_boranga()

You can use them to mark places you want to revisit later:

.. code-block:: python

    for partygoer in partygoers:
        for balloon in balloons:
            for cupcake in cupcakes:
                # TODO: Reduce time complexity here.  It's killing us
                #  for large parties.
                resolve_party_favor(partygoer, balloon, cupcake)

Comments about Comments
-----------------------

 * Be judicious in your use of comments.

 * Use them when you need to.

 * Make them useful.

 * Do not use them merely to restate what the code is / should be doing. Make the code self explanatory!

This is not useful:

.. code-block:: python

    for sponge in sponges:
        # apply soap to each sponge
        worker.apply_soap(sponge)

Note: Nothing special about Python here -- basic good programing practice.  Note that you will need a lto fewer comments if you choose your names well!

Docstrings
----------

In Python, "docstrings" are used to provide in-line documentation in a number of places.

The first place we will see is in the definition of functions.

As you know, to define a function you use the ``def`` keyword.

If a "string literal" is the first thing in the function block following the
header, it is a "docstring":

.. code-block:: python

    def complex_function(arg1, arg2, kwarg1='banana'):
        """Return a value resulting from a complex calculation."""
        # code block here

You can then read this in an interpreter as the ``__doc__`` attribute of the
function object. Docstrings can also be read and processed by documentation systems and IDEs like iPython.

A Function Docstring Should:
............................

* Be a complete sentence in the form of a command describing what the function
  does.

  * """Return a list of values based on blah blah""" is a good docstring

  * """Returns a list of values based on blah blah""" is *not* as good..

* Have a useful single line.

  * If more description is needed, make the first line a complete sentence and
    add more lines below for enhancement.

* Be enclosed with triple-quotes.

  * This allows for easy expansion if required at a later date.
  * Always close on the same line if the docstring is only one line.

For any functions that are less than trivial, and particulalry if they take multiple parameters, the parameters should be described in the docstring:

.. code-block:: python

    def complex_function(arg1, arg2, kwarg1='banana'):
        """
        Return a value resulting from a complex calculation.

        :param arg1: The first very important parameter. And a bit about
                     what it means.
        :param arg2: The second very important parameter. And now some
                     description of how this is used
        :param kwarg1='banana': An optional parameter. Some text describing
                                what it means and why you might specify it.

        """
        # The actual code here

The ``:param arg1:`` notation is "restructured text" -- very handy if you want your docstrings to be able to be automatically processed by documentation systems such as `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_
