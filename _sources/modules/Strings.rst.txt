Strings
=======

.. admonition:: Joke

  A piece of string is new in town, and looking for a drink. He sees a local bar, walks in, sits down, and orders a beer. The bartender looks at him askance, and says: "wait a minute, are you a piece of string?". "Why yes", the string replies.  The bartender growls back: "We don't serve your kind in here -- you get out!".

  Disappointed, the piece of string leaves and heads down the street to the next bar, but this time, he barely gets to a seat before being yelled at -- "we don't want any string in here -- you get out!"

  A third bar, and he has a similar encounter. Now he's getting pretty distraught and confused -- "what have they got against string in this town?", he asks himself. But he's also tired and thirsty, so he gets an idea.

  The piece of string twists himself all up, winding himself around and around. Then he reaches up and fluffs up the top of his head.

  Thus prepared, he heads into yet another bar. This time is different. He walks in, sits down, the bartender takes his order -- all good. But then just as the bartender is putting his beer down he stops, and looks hard at him: "wait a minute! you're a piece of string, aren't you?".

  Full of confidence, the string replies: "Nope, I'm a frayed knot."

A "String" is a computerese word for a piece of text -- a "string" of characters. Why "string"? "String" can be used to mean "(a linear sequence (as of characters, words, proteins, etc.)"
(`definition of string <http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=string>`_)

So a string is a sequence of individual letters or characters.

In Python, each character can be a `Unicode <https://unicode.org/>`_ character -- that is, any character in any language in the world.  Having this built in by default in Python (3) means that you can get very far simply ignoring it -- anything you can type on your computer can be used in strings in Python. If you do need to work with non-English characters, or data encoded in non-utf-8, particularly on Python 2, here are some notes about that: :ref:`unicode`. But for the most part, in Python3 -- strings are text, and text is string, and that's that.

Creating strings:
-----------------

A string literal creates a string type.

(we've seen this already...)

A literal can be delineated with single or double quotes, alone or in triples.

::

    "this is a string"

    'So is this'

    """and this also"""

    '''and even this
    triple quotes preserve newlines
    so this is three lines'''

You can also use call the string object (``str()``) to "make" a string out of other data types.

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [256]: str(34)
    Out[256]: '34'

Strings can also be read from files or other sources of I/O.

String Methods
===============

The python string object is very powerful with lots of methods for common text manipulation. "methods" are functions defined on an object itself (more on that when we get to OO programming). But it means that you have many ways to manipulate text built right into the string objects themselves.

Note that strings are "immutable" --they can not be changed once they have been created. So the string methods all return new objects, rather than change the string in place.

Here are just a few of the more common string methods:

Splitting and Joining Strings
-----------------------------

``split`` and ``join`` can be used to break up a string into pieces, or make one big string out of multiple smaller pieces:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [167]: csv = "comma,separated,values"

    In [168]: csv.split(',')
    Out[168]: ['comma', 'separated', 'values']

    In [169]: psv = '|'.join(csv.split(','))

    In [170]: psv
    Out[170]: 'comma|separated|values'

It may seem odd at first that ``.join()`` is a string method, rather than, say, a method on lists. But in fact, it makes a lot of sense. Lists (and tuples, and other sequences) can hold any type of data -- and "joining" arbitrary data types doesn't make any sense.  Joining is strictly a string activity.

And you need a string so you can join the parts -- therefore, we need a string object in there somewhere anyway.

Lastly, having join() be a string method means that it can join strings in ANY iterable object -- not just lists or other built-in sequence types.

So it does make sense -- but even if doesn't make sense to you, that's the way it is -- so remember that you call ``.join()`` on the string you want to join things with.

So to be clear: if you have a bunch of strings in a sequence and you want to put them together, you create a string with the character (or characters) you want to join them with, and call join() on that object:

.. code-block:: python

    In [20]: # comma separated:

    In [21]: ",".join(["these", "are", "some", "strings"])
    Out[21]: 'these,are,some,strings'

    In [22]: # you can concatenate by joining with the empty string:

    In [23]: "".join(["these", "are", "some", "strings"])
    Out[23]: 'thesearesomestrings'

Maybe not very common, but you can join with a longer string as well:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [5]: " --#-- ".join(["these", "are", "some", "strings"])
    Out[5]: 'these --#-- are --#-- some --#-- strings'

Building up a Long String.
--------------------------

An obvious thing to do is something like:

.. code-block:: python

  msg = ""
  for piece in list_of_stuff:
      msg += piece

But: strings are immutable -- Python needs to create a new string each time you add a piece, which is not very efficient.  So it's better to gather all the pieces together in a list, and then join them together:

.. code-block:: python

   msg = []
   for piece in list_of_stuff:
       msg.append(piece)
   " ".join(msg)

appending to lists is efficient -- and so is the ``join()`` method of strings.

Case Switching
--------------

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [171]: sample = 'A long string of words'

    In [172]: sample.upper()
    Out[172]: 'A LONG STRING OF WORDS'

    In [173]: sample.lower()
    Out[173]: 'a long string of words'

    In [174]: sample.swapcase()
    Out[174]: 'a LONG STRING OF WORDS'

    In [175]: sample.title()
    Out[175]: 'A Long String Of Words'


Testing for certain classes of characters
-----------------------------------------

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [181]: number = "12345"

    In [182]: number.isnumeric()
    Out[182]: True

    In [183]: number.isalnum()
    Out[183]: True

    In [184]: number.isalpha()
    Out[184]: False

    In [185]: fancy = "Th!$ $tr!ng h@$ $ymb0l$"

    In [186]: fancy.isalnum()
    Out[186]: False


String Literals
-----------------

Sometimes when you are creating a string, you want to put an non-normal character in there --one that isn't strictly a letter or symbol, such as newlines, etc.

To do that, python support a set of "escape" sequences -- when a character follows a backslash, it gets interpreted as having a particular meaning.

Common Escape Sequences::

    \\  Backslash (\)
    \a  ASCII Bell (BEL)
    \b  ASCII Backspace (BS)
    \n  ASCII Linefeed (LF)
    \r  ASCII Carriage Return (CR)
    \t  ASCII Horizontal Tab (TAB)
    \ooo  Character with octal value ooo
    \xhh  Character with hex value hh
    \uxxxx Character with Unicode code point value xxxx
    \N{char-name} Character with Unicdoe name char_name

For example -- for tab-separated values:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [25]: s = "these\tare\tseparated\tby\ttabs"

    In [12]: print(s)
    these   are separated   by  tabs

https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals

https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods

Raw Strings
------------

There are times when you want a literal backslash in your string: Windows file paths, regular expressions.  To make this easy, Python support "raw" strings -- string literals where the backslash does not have special meaning:

Add an ``r`` in front of the string literal:

**Escape Sequences Ignored**

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [408]: print("this\nthat")
    this
    that

    In [409]: print(r"this\nthat")
    this\nthat

**Gotcha**

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [415]: r"\"
    SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal

Putting a backslash right before the end quote confuses the interpreter!

Raw strings can be very handy for things like regular expressions that need embedded backslashes.

Building Long String Literals
-----------------------------

If you put two string literals next to each other in the code, Python will join them into one when compiling:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [6]: "this" "that"
    Out[6]: 'thisthat'

(note: no comma in between!)
THis may not look useful, but when combined with the fact that Python joins together lines when inside a parentheses, it can be a nice way to make larger string literals:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [7]: print("This is the first line\n"
       ...:       "And here is another line\n"
       ...:       "If I don't put in a newline"
       ...:       "I can get an very long line in, without making the"
       ...:       "line of code too long.")
    This is the first line
    And here is another line
    If I don't put in a newlineI can get an very long line in, without making the line of code too long.

Ordinal values
--------------

Characters in strings are stored as numeric values:

* "ASCII" values: 1-127

* Unicode "code points" -- 1 - 1,114,111 (!!!)

Unicode supports a LOT of characters -- every character in every language known to man -- and then some :-). The Unicode code poitns for the characters in the ASCII character set are the same as ASCII -- so handy for us English speakers.

To get the value, use ``ord()``:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [109]: for i in 'Chris':
       .....:     print(ord(i), end=' ')
    67 104 114 105 115

To get the character from the code point, use ``chr()``:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [110]: for i in (67,104,114,105,115):
       .....:     print(chr(i), end='')
    Chris

For the English language, stick with ASCII, otherwise use, full Unicode: it's easy with Python3

Building Strings from Data
--------------------------

We often have some data in Python variables -- maybe strings, maybe numbers -- and we often want to combine that data with text to make a custom message of some sort.

You could, but please don't(!), do this:

.. code-block:: python

    'Hello ' + name + '!'

(I know -- we did that in the grid_printing exercise)

Why not? It's slow and not very flexible.  Python provides a few ways to "format" text, so you can do this instead:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [11]: 'Hello {}!'.format(name)
    Out[11]: 'Hello Chris!'

It's much faster and safer, and easier to modify as code gets complicated.

https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string-formatting


Old and New string formatting
-----------------------------

Back in early Python days, there was the string formatting operator: ``%``

.. code-block:: python

    "a string: %s and a number: %i "%("text", 45)

This is very similar to C-style string formatting (`sprintf`).

It's still around, and handy --- but ...

The "new" ``format()`` method is more powerful and flexible, so we'll focus on that in this class.  And there is now the newer "f-strings" (see below) which provide a lot of that "quick and dirty" convenience, while using the same formatting codes as ``.format()``

String Formatting
-----------------

The string ``.format()`` method:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [62]: "A decimal integer is: {:d}".format(34)
    Out[62]: 'A decimal integer is: 34'

    In [63]: "a floating point is: {:f}".format(34.5)
    Out[63]: 'a floating point is: 34.500000'

    In [64]: "a string is the default: {}".format("anything")
    Out[64]: 'a string is the default: anything'


Multiple placeholders:
-----------------------

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [65]: "the number is {} is {}".format('five', 5)
    Out[65]: 'the number is five is 5'

    In [66]: "the first 3 numbers are {}, {}, {}".format(1,2,3)
    Out[66]: 'the first 3 numbers are 1, 2, 3'

The counts must agree:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [67]: "string with {} formatting {}".format(1)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-67-a079bc472aca> in <module>()
    ----> 1 "string with {} formatting {}".format(1)

    IndexError: tuple index out of range


Named Placeholders:
-------------------

.. code-block:: ipython


    In [69]: "Hello, {name}, whadaya know?".format(name="Joe")
    Out[69]: 'Hello, Joe, whadaya know?'

You can use values more than once, and skip values:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [73]: "Hi, {name}. Howzit, {name}?".format(name='Bob')
    Out[73]: 'Hi, Bob. Howzit, Bob?'


The format operator works with string variables, too:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [80]: s = "{:d} / {:d} = {:f}"

    In [81]: a, b = 12, 3

    In [82]: s.format(a, b, a/b)
    Out[82]: '12 / 3 = 4.000000'

So you can save a format string, or even built it up dynamically, and then use it in multiple places in the code.


Complex Formatting
------------------

There is a complete syntax for specifying all sorts of options.

It's well worth your while to spend some time getting to know this
`formatting language`_. You can accomplish a great deal just with this.

.. _formatting language: https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language

Here is a nice tutorial:

https://pyformat.info/

And a nice formatting cookbook:

Literal String Interpolation
============================

In Python 3.6, yet another string formatting method was introduced.

Known at "f-strings", or more formally, "Literal String Interpolation", they provide a concise, readable way to include the value of Python expressions inside strings. In particular, they make it easy to include names in the current namespace without having to type them multiple times.

For example:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [24]: first = "Chris"

    In [25]: last = "Barker"

    In [26]: f"My name is {first} {last}"
    Out[26]: 'My name is Chris Barker'

Note that they are called "f-strings" because they are created by putting and "f" before the string -- "f" is for format.

All the other ways to do this required a lot more typing:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [28]: "My name is {first} {last}".format(first=first, last=last)
    Out[28]: 'My name is Chris Barker'

    In [29]: "My name is {} {}".format(first, last)
    Out[29]: 'My name is Chris Barker'

    In [30]: "My name is %s %s" % (first, last)
    Out[30]: 'My name is Chris Barker'

f-string basics
---------------

f-strings are actually pretty simple concept:

You can interpolate the stringifcation of any expression into a string at run time. Variables are all evaluated at the current scope.

The expression is put inside curly brackets: {}, the same as for the ``.format`` method.

So what does that all mean?

For this most simple example::

  f"some text: {expression}"

`expression` is any valid python expression (remember that an expression is a combination of values and operators and names that produces a value).

The expression is evaluated, and then, if it is not a string, it is converted to one, so it's really::

  f"some text: {str(expression)}"

Let's see how this works in practice:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [32]: # define a couple of names:

    In [33]: x = 5

    In [34]: y = 12

    In [35]: name = "fred"

    In [36]: # a simple string:

    In [37]: f"some text: {name}"
    Out[37]: 'some text: fred'

    In [38]: # if it's not a string, it will be turned into one:

    In [39]: f"some text: {x}"
    Out[39]: 'some text: 5'

    In [40]: # but you can do a more complex expression as well:

    In [41]: f"some text: {x + y}"
    Out[41]: 'some text: 17'

    In [42]: # and call methods:

    In [43]: f"some text: {name.capitalize()}"
    Out[43]: 'some text: Fred'

    In [45]: # even boolean expressions:

    In [46]: f"some text: {name if x < 5 else name2}"
    Out[46]: 'some text: bob'

You can put ANY expression in there -- no matter how complex. But do be careful, if it's too complex, it will just make the code harder to read!

And it has to be an expression, not a statement -- so you can't put a for loop or anything like that in there.

You can see how this can be a very powerful and quick way to get things done.

F-string Use
------------

F-strings are a fairly new Python feature. They will cause a syntax error in any Python version older than 3.6 -- 3.6 was first released on December 23, 2016 -- only a couple years from this writing.

So there is not much out there in the wild, and I have yet to see it in production code.

They are not currently used in many of the examples in this course.

Nevertheless, they are a nifty feature that could be very useful, so feel free to use them where it makes you code cleaner and clearer.
