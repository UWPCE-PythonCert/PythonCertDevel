Python Language Topics

The Python Glossary:
====================

If you find yourself confused about an terms in this document or elsewhere, the python glossary is a good place to start:

https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-parameter


Sequences and Slicing
======================

Arguments and Parameters
========================

Things can get a little confusing about positional vs keyword arguments vs default parameters, etc.. And, of course the dreaded `*args` and `**kwargs`. A good place to start for definitions of terms is the glossary:

https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-parameter

and then a nice discussion of what all that means:

Python Style:
=============

Of course, PEP8 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is the place to start with coding style, but if you want to go beyond that, here's a good start:

Comprehensions:

Object Oriented Programming: classes
====================================

``super()``
-----------

``super`` is a pretty confusing topic! Here are some good resources:

Raymond Hettinger's PyCon2015 talk: "Super Considered Super"

https://youtu.be/EiOglTERPEo

and the original blog post:

`Super Considered Super <https://rhettinger.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/super-considered-super/>`_

Which was in response to this original post:

`Super Considered Harmful <https://fuhm.net/super-harmful/>`_


Concurrency
===========

Concurrency is a pretty big topic, but here are few good ones:

General introduction to the concept with examples of both threads and processes:

Threading
---------

Threading and GUI programming:

Understanding the GLobal Interpeter Lock:
`"Groc the GIL:"<https://opensource.com/article/17/4/grok-gil>`_

Asynchronous Programming
------------------------

Recent versions of Python have added support for asynchronous programming. It is a whole new way to deal with program flow.

Here are some resources to help you "get" it:

Asyncio for the working Python developer
----------------------------------------
This one talks about why you might want to do async development.

Assorted from David Beazley
---------------------------

David Beazley is scary smart, and types much faster than most of us can think. But on video, you can pause and take the take to catch up with him, and learn a lot:

This one in particular -- ALL live demo. Really hard to keep up -- but really informative!
