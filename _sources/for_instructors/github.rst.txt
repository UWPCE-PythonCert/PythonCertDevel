Using gitHub
############

We use gitHub in the program to provide a platform for students to submit their work, and instructors to review that work.

gitHub provides a good platform for code review, and it also provides the students with some experience with an industry-standard platform.

The class repo
==============

There is a gitHub org for the class repos here:

https://github.com/UWPCE-PythonCert-ClassRepos

And a template here:

https://github.com/UWPCE-PythonCert-ClassRepos/ClassRepoTemplate

Before the class starts, the instructor should make a ocpy of that TEmplate repo, and crate a new one labeled something like:

``Fall2018-PY210A`` or ``Sp2018-Online``

Make sure your students know which repo to fork and use for your class -- probably by updating Canvas or EdX for your instance.

Class Repo Structure
--------------------

The class repo has three directories in it::

     students
     examples
     solutions

The ``students`` dir is where each student should create a directory for their own work. They can then submit a gitHub PR to add their dir to the class repo, and to have their work reviewed when it is ready to be turned in.

The ``examples`` dir can be used to put examples of various sorts -- either from the main PythonCertDevel repo -- or anything you work up for class. It is a good place to put code developed during class as well, so everyone can have access in the future.

The ``solutions`` dir can be used to post solutions to the exercises. How and when (and if) you do that is up the the individual instructor, and may be different depending on the modality. i.e. for self-paced inline there may no appropriate time to post solutions.


Example Code
============

Examples are in the PythonCert Repo under examples. Most of the single file examples are provided as download links in the course materials. But some examples get to be too big to be a simple single file download.

You may want to copy examples to the class repo, for easy access by the students.

I also find that I often will update and re-work examples, as well as provide new ones, during the class sessions. It's a good idea to make those available int he class repo as well.

If you develop a nice example that may be useful to other instructors / classes, consider adding it to the examples in the main PythonCertDevel repo.
