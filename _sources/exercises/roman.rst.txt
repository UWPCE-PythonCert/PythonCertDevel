Roman/Arabic Numeral Converter
==============================

Roman and Arabic numerals are different enough that a program to convert back and forth between the two systems would be useful assuming, of course, that you are a Roman trader living sometime in the Middle Ages with access to a computer with a Python interpreter.

Write a class-based program to convert between the two formats.
