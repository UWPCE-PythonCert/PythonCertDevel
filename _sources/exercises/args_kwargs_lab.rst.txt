Args and Kwargs LAB
===================

Goal:
-----

Develop an understanding of using advanced argument passing and parameter definitons.

If this is all confusing -- you may want to review this:

http://stupidpythonideas.blogspot.com/2013/08/arguments-and-parameters.html

Note:

This is not all that clearly specified -- the goal is for you to
experiment with various ways to define and call functions, so you
can understand what's possible, and what happens with each call.
It is also entirely silly, since the function does not do anything
at all, but it will teach you about using parameters effectively.


Test Driven Development?
------------------------

Since this code isn't really going to do anything, it doesn't make a lot of sense to test it.  However, you need to run the code somehow anyway. So this is a good chance to practice test-driven development anyway.

So for each step of the exercise, write a test that calls your function in a particular way, and test that it returns what you expect. In this case, what you will be testing is not really the code -- but rather your own expectations of what the results should be.

You will also be testing Python's argument handling, which you can be pretty sure DOES work correctly.

So while these won't be useful tests in the usual sense, this is a chance to practice test driven development.


Procedure
---------

We are going to do this as test driven development. So your first task for
each assignment below is to write a test that will ensure your code does what
we are telling you it should do.

**Keyword arguments:**

* Write a function that has four optional parameters (with defaults):

  - `fore_color`
  - `back_color`
  - `link_color`
  - `visited_color`

* Have it return the colors (use strings for the colors)

* Call it with a couple different parameters set. IOW, write tests that verify that all of the following work as advertised:

  - using just positional arguments:

    - ``func('red', 'blue', 'yellow', 'chartreuse')``

  - using just keyword arguments:

    -  ``func(link_color='red', back_color='blue')``

  - using a combination of positional and keyword

    -  ````func('purple', link_color='red', back_color='blue')``

  - using ``*some_tuple`` and/or ``**some_dict``

    - ``regular = ('red', 'blue')``

    - ``links = {'link_color': 'chartreuse'}``

    - ``func(*regular, **links)``


**Generic parameters:**

* Write a new function with the parameters as:

``*args`` and ``**kwargs``

* Have it return the colors (use strings for the colors)

* Call it with the same various combinations of arguments used above.

*  Also have it print `args` and `kwargs` directly, so you can be sure you understand what's going on.

* Note that in general, you can't know what will get passed into ``**kwargs`` So maybe adapt your function to be able to do something reasonable with any keywords.
