Pre-class prep
==============

Get your Environment set up!

**Install Python**

:ref:`installing_python`

**Set Up a Great Dev Environment**

Make sure you have the basics of command line usage down:

Work through the supplemental tutorials on setting up your
Command Line (::ref:`shell_customization`) for good development support.

Make sure you've got your editor set up productively -- at the very very
least, make sure it does Python indentation and syntax coloring well.

:ref:`setting_up_dev_environment`


In-class Activities
===================

Introduction to the class and each-other.

Setting up the class git repo

Quickie Python Introduction

A few exercises: :ref:`python_pushups`


Post-class Activites
====================

Finish the Excercises

Finish getting your environment set up


Reading, etc.
-------------

Every one of you has a different backgrond and learning style.

So take a bit of time to figure out which resource works for you.

:ref:`python_learning_resources` provides some options. Do look it over.

But here are few to get you started this week:

*Think Python:* Chapters 1–7 (http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/)

*Dive Into Python:* Chapters 1–2 (http://www.diveintopython3.net/)

*LPTHW:* ex. 1–10, 18-21 (http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
  **NOTE:** LPTHW is python 2 -- you will need to add parentheses to all yoru print calls!

Or follow this excellent introductory tutorial:

http://pyvideo.org/video/1850/a-hands-on-introduction-to-python-for-beginning-p

(also python2 -- so same thing with the print function...)

You should be comfortable with working with variables, numbers, strings, and basic functions.
