Booleans
========

With Rick Riehle
----------------

In a certain sense there isn't much to talk about with regard to booleans. Everybody knows what the word boolean means: true of false, yes or no. I could call it good, we're done here, drop the mic.

But of course there is more to it than that. We have developed this idea in the progrmaming world... I don't know if it originated in the halls of computer science departments or if it's more of a hacker term, and that idea is "truthy". Truthiness, truthy and falsy. Odd sounding terms if you haven't heard them before. They sound somewhat iffy or floaty, as if Truth were hard to pin down. Well, truth is hard to pin down, but that's not the sort of truth we're talking about. Let's get back to simple booleans, true and false, and we'll return to this idea of truthiness later.

Amoung Python's key/reserved words are ``True`` and ``False``.  You can test for these values when making flow control decisions.

if (3 + 3 == 6) is True:
    print("Woo! Math")
