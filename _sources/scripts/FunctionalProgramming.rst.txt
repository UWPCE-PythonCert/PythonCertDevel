Functional Programming
======================

With Rick Riehle
----------------

Let's start with high school math. As you will recall, functions take arguments and return a value. The strict definition can be found on Wikipedia_:

Function
  In mathematics, a function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs with the property that each input is related to exactly one output.

So functions take arguments and return a single, deterministic output, and for a given set of arguments the same value is always returned.

Functions in Python start here, and indeed when programming according to the Functional Programming paradigm they tend to stay here and not go much beyond. Let's think about that.

 adhere to this basic form when constructing functions, yet functions in Python can be much more. Before we get ahead of ourselves let's look at a few basic definitions.
